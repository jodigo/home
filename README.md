## Jodi Gunawan Personal Website

This project is my personal portfolio/website.

### Motivation

Web Development has evolved a lot and has evolved fast. There are too many number of options available on the frontend. In my work experience, I ended up learning React.js and realized how great it is. Not too long ago, React also released *Hooks*, a new addition to 16.8. Being very interested in this, I decided to make a simple-ish website to practice React's Hook and how to use `useState`. I also realized that its about time to make my personal portfolio.
