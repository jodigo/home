### Motivation

Web Development has evolved a lot and has evolved fast. There are too many number of options available on the frontend. I ended up learning React.js from work and realized how great it is. Not too long ago, React also released *Hooks*, a new addition to 16.8. Being very interested in this, I decided to make a simple-ish website to practice React's *Hooks* and how to use `useState`. I also realized that its about time to make my personal portfolio.

### Development

1. Clone repository.
2. `cd home` to repo.
3. `npm install`.
4. `npm start`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Deployment

`npm run deploy`

Deployed using github-pages.
